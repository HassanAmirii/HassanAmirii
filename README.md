Hi there! 
I'm Hassan, a budding software engineer from Lagos, Nigeria.

I'm currently working on HTML, CSS, and diving into JavaScript to strengthen my web development skills. Alongside, I'm independently studying calculus and linear algebra to sharpen my mathematical foundation for computer science.

I’m also working on building a school information portal and website, aiming to enhance the technological infrastructure at the school where I teach.
