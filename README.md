#### Hey, I’m Hassan — backend eng: hassanamiri.ai@gmail.com


- pushing frontend but did'nt enjoy making some stupid ass button dance on sight
- decided to push backend
- why? good question, well seems like i mostly enjoy the mostly ugly and important part of getting the job done; also that is where the real grind is so why not?
- here is the roadmap ive been following [@backend/roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/backend)


- here are my top 5 lovely projects & well written notes; wip tho
